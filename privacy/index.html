        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="policy-date">Effective Date: December 25, 2025</p>

        <p>Scrollless ("we", "our", or "us") provides a mobile application (the "App") that helps users set timers for phone sessions to reduce distraction and promote mindful usage. Your privacy is central to the App's design. This Policy explains what information we do and do not collect, how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>

        <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Scrollless collects anonymous usage data through Google Firebase to improve performance and reliability. This includes: the number of sessions started and completed, average session duration, device type and OS version, and general crash/performance information. This data is strictly anonymous and used solely to enhance functionality—it does not identify you personally.</p>

        <h2>What Data We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal data. We do not collect, transmit, or have access to: your name, email, phone number, location, the list of apps installed on your phone, which apps you open or use, your browsing history, or any files, messages, contacts, or private information stored on your device. All user activity on your device remains local and private.</p>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>Scrollless uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may use device identifiers or similar technologies to deliver and measure advertisements according to Google's policies and your ad personalization settings. In the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, advertising is shown in accordance with your device and Google consent settings (for example, prompts presented by Google's User Messaging Platform). Scrollless itself does not access or store any data used by AdMob.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Scrollless does not use cookies. Third-party tools such as Google AdMob and Firebase use standard tracking technologies to measure performance and improve reliability. You can adjust ad personalization and related settings in your Android device or Google Account at any time.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Google AdMob and any future Firebase analytics may process information on servers outside your country. Such transfers rely on standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards made available by Google.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because Scrollless does not collect personal data, there are no accounts or databases storing identifiable information. All Firebase analytics transmissions use encrypted connections (HTTPS) and data is processed in line with Swiss and EU standards. While platform sandboxing and encryption are used, no method is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>User activity information is stored only on your device. Anonymous Firebase analytics are retained only as long as necessary to maintain and improve performance. We do not retain or back up any personal data.</p>

        <h2>Legal Disclosures</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share data. We may disclose limited technical information (such as crash diagnostics) if required by applicable law, regulation, or court order, or to protect our rights and users' safety.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy periodically to reflect product changes or legal requirements. Significant updates will be posted on our website and in-app, and the "Effective Date" above will be revised. Continued use of the App after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>
