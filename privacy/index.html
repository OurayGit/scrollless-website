        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="policy-date">Effective Date: October 12, 2025</p>

        <p>Scrollless ("we", "our", or "us") provides a mobile application (the "App") that helps users set timers for phone sessions to reduce distraction and promote mindful usage. Your privacy is central to the App's design. This Policy explains what information we do and do not collect, how it may be used in the future, and how it is protected.</p>

        <h2>What Data We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>Scrollless operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or have access to: the list of apps installed on your phone; which apps you open, block, or use; the duration or content of your sessions; or any files, messages, contacts, or private information stored on your device. All data remains local and never leaves your phone.</p>

        <h2>What We May Collect in the Future</h2>
        <p>To improve performance and reliability, future versions of Scrollless may collect anonymous usage statistics through Google Firebase, such as the number of sessions started and completed, average session duration, device type and OS version, and general crash/performance information. This information would be strictly anonymous, used solely to enhance functionality, and would not identify you personally. If such data collection begins, this Policy will be updated in the App and on our website.</p>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>Scrollless uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may use device identifiers or similar technologies to deliver and measure advertisements according to Google's policies and your ad personalization settings. In the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, advertising is shown in accordance with your device and Google consent settings (for example, prompts presented by Google's User Messaging Platform). Scrollless itself does not access or store any data used by AdMob.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Scrollless does not use cookies. Third-party tools such as Google AdMob (and Firebase, if activated in the future) may use standard tracking technologies to measure performance and improve reliability. You can adjust ad personalization and related settings in your Android device or Google Account at any time.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Google AdMob and any future Firebase analytics may process information on servers outside your country. Such transfers rely on standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards made available by Google.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because Scrollless does not collect personal data, there are no servers, accounts, or external databases associated with the App. If anonymous analytics are added in the future, transmissions will use encrypted connections (HTTPS) and data will be processed in line with Swiss and EU standards. While platform sandboxing and encryption are used, no method is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since information is currently stored only on your device, no data is retained or backed up by us. Should anonymous analytics be introduced, any telemetry would be stored only as long as necessary to maintain and improve performance.</p>

        <h2>Legal Disclosures</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share data. We may disclose limited technical information (such as crash diagnostics) if required by applicable law, regulation, or court order, or to protect our rights and users' safety.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy periodically to reflect product changes or legal requirements. Significant updates will be posted on our website and in-app, and the "Effective Date" above will be revised. Continued use of the App after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>
