                <h2>That empty feeling after an hour of doomscrolling?</h2>
                <p>Your eyes hurt, your head is buzzing, and you can almost feel the brainrot setting in. Scrollless helps you break that loop.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-block">
                <h2>Flexible, not restrictive.</h2>
                <p>You choose which apps to keep in check and how long each session should last. When the timer ends, all apps take a short five-minute break. It’s the best moment to put your phone away and get back to what matters.</p>
                <p>Unlike most screen time apps that lock you out for fixed hours, Scrollless adapts to your daily use and limits only how long you stay per session.</p>

            <section class="content-block features">
                <h2>What makes it work</h2>
                <ul class="features-list">
                    <li><strong>Custom session timers</strong> for the apps you choose</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart five-minute breaks</strong> that reset your focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Subtle incentives</strong> that help you prefer shorter sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>No fixed hours,</strong> just balanced sessions that fit your day</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For longer sessions, there is a short delay before you can access the apps. You can also unlock a free day without timers, but only after waiting a few minutes.</p>
