        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="policy-date">Last updated: October 12, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Scrollless. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Scrollless mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>Scrollless helps users manage their screen time by setting session timers and promoting mindful phone usage. The App is designed as a personal wellbeing and productivity tool. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any medical or psychological condition and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice or therapy.</p>

        <h2>2. Developer Information</h2>
        <p>Scrollless is developed and operated by an independent developer based in Switzerland. For all inquiries related to these Terms, please contact <a href="mailto:scrollless.app@gmail.com">scrollless.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility and Use</h2>
        <p>You must be legally capable of entering into binding agreements under the laws of your jurisdiction to use this App. The App is intended for general audiences and is not directed at children under the age of 13.</p>
        <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to install and use Scrollless on your personal device solely for non-commercial purposes. You may not copy, modify, distribute, decompile, or reverse-engineer any part of the App, nor may you use it in any unlawful, abusive, or disruptive manner. All rights not expressly granted to you remain reserved to the developer.</p>

        <h2>4. Privacy and Data</h2>
        <p>At present, Scrollless stores all user data locally on your device. No personal data is collected or transmitted to the developer. In the future, the App may process anonymous usage data to improve functionality and performance. Should this occur, the Privacy Policy will be updated and made available on our website and within the App.</p>
        <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements and may in the future integrate Firebase for analytics and error reporting. These services are provided by Google LLC and governed by Google's own policies. Scrollless does not assume responsibility for data practices of third parties.</p>

        <h2>5. Connectivity</h2>
        <p>Scrollless functions primarily offline. Certain components, such as advertisements or version updates, may require an active internet connection. You are solely responsible for any connectivity or data costs that may arise when using the App.</p>

        <h2>6. Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request Android permissions such as Usage Access, Accessibility Service, and "Draw over other apps" solely to enable session timers and focus overlays. You can revoke permissions at any time in system settings; certain features may then become unavailable.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Terms</h2>
        <p>Your use of the App may also be subject to third-party terms and policies, including those of Google Play and Google AdMob. Where applicable, those terms govern your relationship with those third parties.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available," at your own risk, without any express or implied warranty or condition of any kind. The developer expressly disclaims all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. No guarantee is made that the App will function without interruption or error, that defects will be corrected, or that the App will be compatible with all devices or future operating systems. You acknowledge that the App may impact device performance, battery life, or storage and that such effects are inherent to its operation. You assume full responsibility for any damage to your device or loss of data resulting from your use of the App.</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of opportunity, data, business, revenue, or profits, whether arising from contract, tort, negligence, or any other theory of liability, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The developer does not warrant that the App's operation or the delivery of any content will be free from technical failure, defect, or interruption, nor that any data stored on your device will remain secure or intact. Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the App is to cease its use and uninstall it from your device.</p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to Scrollless, including design, user interface, code, logos, and other materials, are and shall remain the exclusive property of the developer. Nothing in these Terms grants you ownership rights or any license other than as expressly stated herein.</p>

        <h2>10. Updates, Modifications, and Termination</h2>
        <p>The developer may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any of its features at any time without prior notice. These Terms may be amended periodically to reflect changes in the App or in applicable law. The updated version will be posted on the Scrollless website and within the App and will take effect upon publication. Continued use of the App after publication of revised Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes. You may discontinue your use of the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of Zug, Switzerland.</p>
